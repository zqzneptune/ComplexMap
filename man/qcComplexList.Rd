\title{Perform Quality Control on a List of Protein Complexes}
\usage{
qcComplexList(complexList, redundancyThreshold = 0.8, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{complexList}{A list where each element is a character vector of
protein identifiers representing a complex.}

\item{redundancyThreshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. A warning will be
issued for any pair of complexes with a Jaccard similarity score greater
than or equal to this threshold. Defaults to 0.8.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print progress messages
and summaries to the console. Defaults to `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the original `complexList` object, allowing it to be used
in a pipeline.
}
\description{
This function performs a quality control analysis on a list of protein
complexes. It provides basic statistics, analyzes the distribution of complex
sizes, and calculates pairwise redundancy using the Jaccard similarity index.
}
\details{
The QC process involves three main steps:
1.  **Basic Statistics:** Reports the total number of complexes and unique
    proteins in the list.
2.  **Size Distribution:** Provides a summary of the number of proteins per
    complex and warns if complexes have fewer than three members.
3.  **Redundancy Analysis:** A sparse binary membership matrix is constructed
    to efficiently calculate the Jaccard similarity for all unique pairs of
    complexes. A warning is issued if a significant portion of pairs
    exceeds the specified `redundancyThreshold`.

\examples{
# Create a sample list of protein complexes
complex1 <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
complex2 <- c("A", "B", "C", "E") # Highly redundant with complex1
complex3 <- c("F", "G", "H")
complex4 <- c("I", "J")          # Small complex
complex5 <- c("X", "Y", "Z")
sampleList <- list(
  C1 = complex1, C2 = complex2, C3 = complex3, C4 = complex4, C5 = complex5
)

# Run the quality control analysis
qcComplexList(sampleList)
