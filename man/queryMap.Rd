\title{Query a ComplexMap Object for Specific Information}
\usage{
queryMap(complexMapObject, query, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{complexMapObject}{A `ComplexMap` object returned by
`createComplexMap()`.}

\item{query}{A character string containing the search term (a protein ID,
complex ID, or theme label).}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of query. Must be one of
`"protein"`, `"complex"`, or `"theme"`.}
}
\value{
A `tibble` containing the rows from the node table that match the
  query. Returns an empty tibble if no matches are found.
}
\description{
Allows for targeted querying of a `ComplexMap` object to find nodes
(complexes) that match specific criteria, such as containing a particular
protein or belonging to a biological theme.
}
\details{
This function supports three distinct modes of querying:
- `type = "protein"`: The `query` is a character string representing a
  protein ID. The function searches the `proteins` column in the node table
  and returns all complexes that contain that protein. The search is exact
  and case-sensitive.
- `type = "complex"`: The `query` is a character string for a complex ID
  (e.g., "CpxMap_0001"). It returns the specific row from the node table
  corresponding to that complex.
- `type = "theme"`: The `query` is a character string corresponding to a
  `themeLabel` from `summarizeThemes()`. To use this, the themes must first
  be calculated and their IDs added to the node table. If the `themeId`
  column is not found, the function will stop with an informative error.
}
\examples{
# Assume 'cm_obj' is a valid ComplexMap object

# Query for a specific protein (e.g., "UBA1")
# uba1_complexes <- queryMap(cm_obj, query = "UBA1", type = "protein")

# Query for a specific complex ID
# cpx1_data <- queryMap(cm_obj, query = "CpxMap_0001", type = "complex")

# To query by theme, you must first run summarizeThemes and add the IDs
# theme_summary <- summarizeThemes(cm_obj)
# nodes <- getNodeTable(cm_obj)
# graph <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(getEdgeTable(cm_obj))
# communities <- igraph::cluster_louvain(graph)$membership
# nodes$themeId <- communities
# cm_obj$nodes <- nodes # Update the object
#
# Then you could query by a theme label from the summary
# proteasome_nodes <- queryMap(cm_obj, query = "Proteasome", type = "theme")
