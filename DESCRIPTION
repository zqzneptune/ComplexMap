Description: Provides a comprehensive workflow for the quality control, 
    refinement, functional enrichment, and network-based analysis of protein 
    complex datasets. ComplexMap allows for the quantitative evaluation of 
    predicted complexes against a reference and provides powerful static and 
    interactive visualization methods to explore the functional landscape of 
    a protein complex map.
