\title{Query a ComplexMap Object for Specific Information}
\usage{
queryMap(complexMapObject, query, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{complexMapObject}{A `ComplexMap` object.}

\item{query}{A character string containing the search term.}

\item{type}{A character string: one of `"protein"`, `"complex"`, or `"theme"`.}
}
\value{
A `tibble` containing the rows from the node table that match the
  query. Returns an empty tibble if no matches are found.
}
\description{
Allows for targeted querying of a `ComplexMap` object to find nodes
(complexes) that match specific criteria, such as containing a particular
protein or belonging to a biological theme.
}
\details{
This function supports three distinct modes of querying:
- `type = "protein"`: Searches for complexes containing a specific protein.
- `type = "complex"`: Retrieves a specific complex by its ID.
- `type = "theme"`: Finds all complexes belonging to a given theme. This
  requires theme information to be added to the `ComplexMap` object first
  (see the "Advanced Analysis" vignette for an example).
}
\examples{
# Assume 'cm_obj' is a valid ComplexMap object
# uba1_complexes <- queryMap(cm_obj, query = "UBA1", type = "protein")
