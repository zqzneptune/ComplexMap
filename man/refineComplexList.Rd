\title{Refine a List of Protein Complexes by Size and Redundancy}
\usage{
refineComplexList(
  complexList,
  minSize = 3,
  maxSize = 500,
  mergeThreshold = 0.9,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{complexList}{A named list where each element is a character vector of
protein identifiers representing a complex.}

\item{minSize}{An integer specifying the minimum number of proteins a complex
must have to be retained. Defaults to 3.}

\item{maxSize}{An integer specifying the maximum number of proteins a complex
can have to be retained. Defaults to 500.}

\item{mergeThreshold}{A numeric value (0-1) for the Jaccard similarity.
Complexes with a score >= this value will be merged. Defaults to 0.9.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print progress messages.
Defaults to `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
A refined and renamed named list of protein complexes.
}
\description{
This function refines a list of protein complexes by first filtering them
based on size and then merging highly redundant complexes based on a Jaccard
similarity threshold.
}
\details{
The refinement process consists of two main stages:
1.  **Size Filtering:** Complexes that are smaller than `minSize` or larger
    than `maxSize` are removed from the list.
2.  **Redundancy Merging:** A Jaccard similarity matrix is calculated for all
    remaining pairs of complexes. A union-find algorithm is then used to
    identify clusters (or "merge groups") of complexes where all members are
    connected by a similarity score greater than or equal to the
    `mergeThreshold`. These groups are then merged into single complexes.

Finally, all complexes in the refined list are renamed to a standardized
format ("CpxMap_0001", "CpxMap_0002", etc.).

\examples{
# Create a sample list of protein complexes
complex1 <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
complex2 <- c("A", "B", "C", "E") # Highly redundant with complex1
complex3 <- c("F", "G", "H")
complex4 <- c("I", "J")          # Too small, will be filtered
sampleList <- list(
  C1 = complex1, C2 = complex2, C3 = complex3, C4 = complex4
)

# Refine the list using a high similarity threshold
refinedList <- refineComplexList(sampleList, mergeThreshold = 0.75)
