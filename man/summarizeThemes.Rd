\title{Summarize Major Biological Themes in a Complex Map}
\usage{
summarizeThemes(complexMapObject, method = "louvain", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{complexMapObject}{A `ComplexMap` object returned by
`createComplexMap()`.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the community detection algorithm
to use. Must be a valid `igraph` clustering function (e.g., "louvain",
"walktrap", "infomap"). Defaults to "louvain".}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A `tibble` where each row represents a summarized theme. The tibble
  contains the following columns:
  - `themeId`: A unique integer identifier for the theme.
  - `themeLabel`: A descriptive label for the theme.
  - `nodeCount`: The number of nodes (complexes) in the theme.
  - `edgeCount`: The number of internal edges within the theme.
}
\description{
This function analyzes the network structure within a `ComplexMap` object to
identify and summarize major biological themes. It uses community detection
algorithms to find densely connected clusters of nodes (themes).
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1.  It constructs an `igraph` graph object from the node and edge tables of
    the `complexMapObject`.
2.  It applies a community detection algorithm (e.g., Louvain, as default)
    to partition the network into clusters or "themes".
3.  For each identified theme, it generates a descriptive `themeLabel` by
    finding the most frequently occurring `primaryFunctionalDomain` among
    the member nodes (excluding "Unenriched").
4.  It calculates summary statistics for each theme, including the number of
    nodes and edges it contains.

\examples{
# Assume 'cm_obj' is a valid ComplexMap object created by createComplexMap()
# if (requireNamespace("igraph", quietly = TRUE)) {
#   themeSummary <- summarizeThemes(cm_obj)
#   print(themeSummary)
# }
