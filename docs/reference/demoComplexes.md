# Example Protein Complex List

A dataset containing a list of 622 putative protein complexes identified
in the study using an integrative global proteomic profiling approach.
This dataset is intended for use in package examples and vignettes.

## Usage

``` r

```

## Format

A named list with 622 elements. Each element is a character vector of
protein identifiers representing a single complex.

## Details

These complexes were derived from chromatographic separation of cultured
human cell extracts into more than one thousand biochemical fractions,
followed by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Most of the
622 complexes are linked to core biological processes and include
candidate disease genes and unannotated proteins.
