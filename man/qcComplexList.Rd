\title{Perform Quality Control on a List of Protein Complexes}
\usage{
qcComplexList(complexList, redundancyThreshold = 0.8, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{complexList}{A list where each element is a character vector of
protein identifiers representing a complex.}

\item{redundancyThreshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. A warning will be
issued for any pair of complexes with a Jaccard similarity score greater
than or equal to this threshold. Defaults to 0.8.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print the QC report to
the console. Defaults to `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the original `complexList` object, allowing it to be used
in a pipeline.
}
\description{
This function performs a quality control analysis on a list of protein
complexes, delivering a user-friendly report with key statistics and
actionable warnings.
}
\details{
The QC process involves three main steps, presented in a clear report:
1.  **Basic Statistics:** Reports the total number of complexes and unique
    proteins.
    
2.  **Size Distribution:** Summarizes the number of proteins per complex,
    highlighting the smallest, median, and largest complexes. It will
    issue an in-report warning if complexes have fewer than 3 members.
    
3.  **Redundancy Analysis:** Calculates the Jaccard similarity for all pairs
    of complexes. It reports the median and maximum similarity and issues an
    in-report warning if any pairs exceed the `redundancyThreshold`.

This function is intended as a **diagnostic tool**. It uses the Jaccard index
for its clear and intuitive interpretation of redundancy. For actively merging
complexes, see the more advanced `refineComplexList()` function.

\examples{
# Create a sample list of protein complexes
complex1 <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
complex2 <- c("A", "B", "C", "E") # Highly redundant with complex1
complex3 <- c("F", "G", "H")
complex4 <- c("I", "J")          # Small complex
sampleList <- list(
  C1 = complex1, C2 = complex2, C3 = complex3, C4 = complex4
)

# Run the quality control analysis to see the new report format
qcComplexList(sampleList)
