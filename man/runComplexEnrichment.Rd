\title{Run Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on a List of Complexes}
\usage{
runComplexEnrichment(
  complexList,
  gmt,
  pAdjustMethod = "Benjamini",
  pValueCutoff = 0.05,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{complexList}{A named list where each element is a character vector of
gene/protein identifiers representing a complex.}

\item{gmt}{A named list where each element is a character vector of genes,
representing a functional gene set (e.g., from a GMT file).}

\item{pAdjustMethod}{A character string specifying the p-value adjustment
method to use for filtering. Must be one of "Benjamini", "Bonferroni",
or "FDR". Defaults to "Benjamini".}

\item{pValueCutoff}{A numeric value used as the cutoff for significance on
the adjusted p-value. Defaults to 0.05.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print progress messages.
Defaults to `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
A named list where each name corresponds to a `complexId` from the input.
Each element is a data frame containing the significant enrichment results
for that complex, with columns: `ID`, `Description`, `p.adjust`, `Count`,
`Ratio`, and `Fold`.
}
\description{
This function performs a hypergeometric-based enrichment analysis for each
protein complex in a list against a provided gene set matrix (GMT).
}
\details{
For each complex, this function calculates the over-representation of
functional terms (e.g., GO terms, pathways) from the GMT file. It uses a
hypergeometric test to compute a p-value, which is then adjusted for
multiple testing.

Only the terms that are significant after filtering by the `pValueCutoff`
are retained in the final output.

\examples{
# --- Sample Data ---
# 1. Complexes to be tested
complex1 <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
complex2 <- c("F", "G", "H")
myComplexes <- list(Cpx1 = complex1, Cpx2 = complex2)

# 2. Gene Set Matrix (e.g., GO terms or pathways)
term1 <- c("A", "B", "C", "X", "Y") # Enriched in Cpx1
term2 <- c("F", "G", "Z")          # Enriched in Cpx2
term3 <- c("L", "M", "N")          # Not enriched
myGmt <- list(Term1 = term1, Term2 = term2, Term3 = term3)

# --- Run Enrichment ---
enrichment <- runComplexEnrichment(myComplexes, myGmt)
print(enrichment)
